# Fever Tree Detection Improvements

## Issue

The system was not consistently detecting "Fever Tree Tonic Water" in receipts, especially when mentioned on the same line as Bloedlemoen Gin, such as:

- "1 Bloedlemoen Amber 750ml + FREE Fever Tree Tonic Water (Pack of 4)"

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Pattern Matching

Updated `feverTreePatterns` with more specific and comprehensive patterns:

**Most Specific Patterns (added first for priority):**

- `/fever\s+tree\s+tonic\s+water\s*\(pack\s+of\s+\d+\)/i` - "Fever Tree Tonic Water (Pack of 4)"
- `/free\s+fever\s+tree\s+tonic\s+water/i` - "FREE Fever Tree Tonic Water"
- `/\+\s*free\s+fever\s+tree/i` - "+ FREE Fever Tree"
- `/fever\s+tree\s+tonic\s+water/i` - "Fever Tree Tonic Water"

**Core Detection:**

- `/fever\s*tree/i` - Any "fever tree" mention (most important)
- `/fever.*tree/i` - "fever" followed by "tree" anywhere in line

### 2. Improved Pack Type Detection

Enhanced `detectFeverTreePackType()` function to better handle:

- `"pack of 4"` and `"(pack of 4)"` formats
- More flexible pattern matching for pack indicators

### 3. Enhanced Debugging

Added comprehensive debugging to track:

- Lines containing "fever tree" combinations
- Lines with both Bloedlemoen and Fever Tree mentions
- Detailed pattern matching results when Fever Tree lines don't match
- Step-by-step pattern testing for troubleshooting

### 4. Processing Logic

The system now:

- Checks each line for both Bloedlemoen AND Fever Tree (they can be on the same line)
- Processes patterns in order of specificity (most specific first)
- Provides detailed console logging for debugging

## Expected Results

With these improvements, the system should now reliably detect:

- ‚úÖ "1 Bloedlemoen Amber 750ml + FREE Fever Tree Tonic Water (Pack of 4)"
- ‚úÖ "FREE Fever Tree Tonic Water"
- ‚úÖ "Fever Tree Tonic Water (Pack of 4)"
- ‚úÖ Any variation of "fever tree" on any line
- ‚úÖ Bundle deals with Bloedlemoen + Fever Tree on same line

## Testing

1. Upload a receipt with the problematic text
2. Check browser console for detailed debugging output
3. Look for "üîç CHECKING LINE WITH FEVER TREE" and "ü•§ FEVER TREE FOUND" messages
4. If a line contains "fever tree" but shows "‚ùå FEVER TREE LINE NOT MATCHED", check the pattern testing results

## Server Status

Development server running on: http://localhost:3001
Ready for testing the improved Fever Tree detection.
